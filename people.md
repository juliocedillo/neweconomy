    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 18px; color: #777;">Associate Professor of Sociology</h3> 
    <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666;">Armando Lara-Millán is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at UC Berkeley. He earned his PhD in Sociology from Northwestern University and is a former Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Scholar. He studies political economy in sociology. For him that means studying changing markets and their enabling institutions, but in such a way that centers history, culture/knowledge, and power. Lara-Millán is an ethnographer of well-positioned organizations and a historian of the fields those organizations shape. He is the current chair-elect of the Sociology of Law Section of the ASA, a faculty affiliate of the Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative, and is currently a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.</p>
