    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 18px; color: #777;">Associate Professor of Sociology</h3> 
    <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666;">Armando Lara-Mill치n is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at UC Berkeley. He earned his PhD in Sociology from Northwestern University and is a former Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Scholar. He studies political economy in sociology. For him that means studying changing markets and their enabling institutions, but in such a way that centers history, culture/knowledge, and power. Lara-Mill치n is an ethnographer of well-positioned organizations and a historian of the fields those organizations shape. He is the current chair-elect of the Sociology of Law Section of the ASA, a faculty affiliate of the Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative, and is currently a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.</p>

    <h2 style="margin: 0; font-size: 24px;">Isaac Dalke</h2>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 18px; color: #777;">Gradute Student Researcher</h3> 
    <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #666;">Isaac is a PhD candidate in the UC Berkeley Sociology Department. His work sits at the intersection of law, politics, and urban life. More concretely, he is interested in how the penal state has evolved in response to broader legal and social change, and the role of nonprofits in defining and responding to social problems in American cities. These two strands come together in his dissertation research, which takes a multifaceted approach to understanding the rise of community-based violence prevention efforts across California. He's interested in how different actors and organizations envision violence prevention, and the practical opportunities and constraints involved in realizing those visions through nonprofit contracting. This ranges from securing funding and developing community partnerships to implementation and evaluating success.</p>
